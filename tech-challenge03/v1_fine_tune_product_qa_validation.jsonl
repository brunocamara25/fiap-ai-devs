In this intimate, extended monologue, the 81-year-old Mortimer holds forth in 32 brief chapters on a wide range of subjects dear to his heart, including such foolish New Labour policies as banning outdoor sex (\"I should include in my will a strong recommendation of the joys of alfresco sex\"); the excesses of political correctness (\"A state in which everyone tiptoed around whispering for fear of hurting somebody's feelings would be dull beyond human endurance\"); the virtues of the young (\"Children can spot pomposity, insincerity and self-regard a mile off and are the best possible antidote to such diseases\"); and the value of vulgarity (\"If you can find a streak of vulgarity in yourself, nurture it\"). As the punning title suggests, this conversational memoir amounts to an informal last will and testament, but the author ends on an uplifting note as he surveys his children and grandchildren. Mortimer fans and all lovers of civilized prose will share his delight.Agent, Michael Sissons at Peters, Fraser and Dunlop.

Once a player commits himself to doing better, and does what it takes to achieve that goal, he or she will improve. Rotella's plan for making and following through on that commitment is an excellent one.

To her credit, she doesn't advise readers to change who they are, but how they present themselves, emphasizing the importance of first impressions and refusing to heap blame on either men or women. Detailed descriptions and checklists will help readers determine what disagreeable stereotype you may projecting (\"The Boss Lady,\" \"The Bait & Switcher,\" \"The Park Avenue Princess\") and how to remedy it. Despite a direct voice and infectious confidence, Greenwald echoes much that's already been covered in countless other volumes-don't seem desperate, show genuine interest, don't bring up your ex-and often with more detail, examples, lists and subcategories than are necessary.

By virtue of this process, Fire Polished beads are all slightly different from each other; this adds to their charm. Unlike Austrian faceted crystals, Fire Polished beads contain no lead. It is the heat polishing process that gives them their soft glow and brilliance. Colors may vary from dye lot to dye lot, so it is best to buy sufficient beads for your project all at one time.

Key to its high performance is a three-ply, bonded construction. Sandwiched between layers of stainless steel is a thick core of pure aluminum that spreads heat evenly across the bottoms of pots and pans and all the way up the sides. The exterior is gleaming, magnetic stainless steel that works on induction as well as conventional stovetops, and, with care, remains beautiful during this cookware's lifetime warranty against defects--and beyond. Certain pieces, like this one, have two interior layers, one of 18/10 stainless steel and the other of scratch-resistant, professional-grade nonstick coating bonded to the steel.This classic, slope-sided fry pan makes clear why All-Clad's Stainless nonstick line is so popular. It's 10 inches in diameter, perfect for cooking tuna or tofu, and the nonstick coating allows you to cook with little or no fat for a healthful meal. Its polished 18/10 stainless-steel handle is riveted to the pan for strength, grooved on the top and rounded on the bottom for comfort, and holed in the end for hanging on a hook or peg. The long handle stays cool on the stovetop but won't be harmed by an oven's heat. Although Stainless cookware is dishwasher-safe, nonstick pieces should be hand washed.--Fred BrackFrom the ManufacturerAll-Clad Stainless ConstructionEach piece of All-Clad cookware features a unique metal bonding construction. All-Clad Stainless cookware sandwiches a thick core of three separate layers of aluminum between an easy-to-clean, highly polished 18/10 stainless-steel cooking surface and a magnetic stainless-steel exterior. The aluminum core retains heat and evenly distributes it along the bottom and up the sidewalls of the cookware. The stainless interior is stick-resistant and cleans easily. The magnetic stainless-steel exterior gives the cookware a gleaming finish. All-Clad Stainless also features the company’s signature \"stay-cool\" long handles, lids fashioned from gleaming 18/10 stainless steel, and highly durable stainless-steel rivets. All-Clad Stainless cookware is one of five collections from All-Clad Metalcrafters. Designed to work on conventional gas and electric ranges, as well as induction cooktops, All-Clad Stainless cookware is the best-selling collection in a full line that includes All-Clad LTD, Cop-R-Chef, Master Chef 2, and Copper Core.Features and BenefitsAll-Clad pans with a stainless interior cooking surface are oven-safe up to 500 degrees. All-Clad pans with a non-stick cooking surface are oven-safe up to 400 degrees, but should not be used under the broiler. We recommend using a low to medium temperature when cooking with All-Clad. Higher heats are not necessary and may cause discoloration (see cleaning instructions below). Other features include:Beautifully polished, magnetic stainless exterior layer.Pure aluminum core that not only covers the bottom of the pan but also extends up the sides. This allows for great heat conductivity as well as an even heat distribution so you won’t have \"hot spots\" when cooking.Stainless-steel interior layer/cooking surface.Long, polished stainless, stay-cool handles.Sturdy, non-corrosive stainless-steel rivets won't react with foods.Polished stainless-steel lids fit evenly with the pan’s edges to seal in flavor of your foods.The All-Clad Stainless collection is compatible with an induction stovetop (with the exception of a few pieces) in addition to gas and electric stovetops.The Stainless collection is dishwasher-safe, excluding pieces with a nonstick cooking surface.WarrantyFrom date of purchase, All-Clad guarantees to repair or replace any item found defective in material, construction or workmanship under normal use and following care instructions. This excludes damage from misuse or abuse. Minor imperfections and slight color variations are normal.Cleaning InstructionsFor daily cleaning, warm soapy water is sufficient. Clean your All-Clad thoroughly after each use. Food films left of the pan may cause discoloration and sticking. To get rid of stuck-on food or discoloration and stains from using too high of a heat, we recommend cleaning your All-Clad with a product called Bar Keeper’s Friend. To use the Bar Keeper’s Friend, simply use a soft cloth or sponge and water and make into a soupy paste. This can be used on the interior, as well as the exterior of your All-Clad (excluding the Cop-R-Chef). The Bar Keeper’s Friend can also be used on the exterior of the All-Clad Stainless collection, LTD collection, and MC2 collection. For cleaning of the Cop-R-Chef exterior, simply use a brass/copper cleaner. If your water has a high iron content, you may notice a rusty discoloration. Use Bar Keeper’s Friend to remove it.All-Clad Stainless SelectionIn recent years, a professional-size 14-inch fry pan was added to the Stainless fry pan assortment, as well as several popular specialty pans, including: the small-size petite brasier with a dome-shaped lid; petite roti roasting pan; and the beautiful, large-capacity Dutch oven and French oven oval roasting pan with roasting rack. Both of these one-pot comfort food specialty pans comes with All-Clad’s popular high dome-shaped lid.

Hedstrom offers a creative spin on a familiar story.\" --The Journal of American History\"An original and eye-opening study, planting liberal religion in the wider history of liberalism, including its middlebrow culture of print. Hedstrom shows how liberal religion keeps renewing itself by sidling up to secular culture, and by welcoming wave after wave of refugees from orthodoxy on the one hand and agnosticism on the other, all of them drawn to the premise of liberal spirituality that science and religion make excellent bedfellows.\"--Richard Fox, Professor of History, University of Southern California\"Smart, innovative, and fascinating... Hedstrom tells a compelling story. He masterfully blends important theoretical insights with an engaging narrative... This is an excellent, well-written, and transformative study that scholars will be wrestling with for years to come.\" --Register of theKentucky Historical Society\"Hedstrom's work is highly recommended to students of American religions, those interested in the history of the book, twentieth-century historians, and scholars of spirituality.\" --Textual Cultures\"Hedstrom shows that the prevailing values of liberal Protestantism were widely disseminated through mass-market, 'middlebrow' books during the middle decades of the twentieth century, influencing ostensibly secular domains of popular culture in ways that no previous scholar has established. This is a strikingly original, crisply argued contribution to cultural and religious history.\"--David A. Hollinger, Preston Hotchkis Professor of History, University of California, Berkeley\"Hedstrom dexterously knots together several cultural threads: liberal Protestantism, middlebrow reading habits, corporate publishing, popular psychology, and seeker spirituality. The expectation that the right religious books-mystical, adventuresome, psychologically attuned, and affordable-would arrest modernity's dissolutions was perhaps another instance of liberal Protestantism's unrequited optimism, but Hedstrom makes a compelling case for just how potent this publishing mission was from the 1920s through the 1940s and beyond.\"--Leigh Eric Schmidt, Edward Mallinckrodt University Professor, Washington University in St. Louis\"In this engrossing study, Matthew Hedstrom provides nothing less than a series of revelations -- about the construction of liberal religion, the circulation of books, and indeed the making of modern spiritual selves. Hedstrom's work will reshape historians' understanding of religion in 20th-century America. For those who wish to push the historical analysis, this book will also invite new questions about liberal religion in 2013 and beyond.\"--Lauren F. Winner, Assistant Professor of Christian Spirituality, Duke Divinity School\"Hedstrom brilliantly describes some of the unforseen results of this new complicity between religion and consumer culture.\" --The Journal of Unitarian Universalist History\"In the modern age of mass-culture and commoditization, liberal religious intellectuals reasoned that the consumption of good books could make a far-reaching contribution to the spiritual formation of American readers. Matthew Hedstrom delivers a deeply thoughtful and thoroughly researched study that urges us to recognize how liberal religion used mass-culture rather than just sneered at it, and to think hard about reading and spirituality today. The legacy of liberal religion is larger than we might have thought.\"--David Morgan, Professor of Religion, Duke University"}]}

Who knew that the park is home to 17 portrait statues, depicting giants from LaSalle to Lincoln and Shakespeare to Sheridan? With this book in hand, one could visit them all over a day or two as well as the sites of seven statues that have gone missing! But Giants in the Park is more than a guidebook. It s an important contribution to our understanding of the times and events, donors and artists, social movements and political forces that not only account for these precious works of public art but also contributed to Chicago s growth and development. As these statues tell their stories through Krista August, we learn more about our remarkable city. As a docent for the Chicago History Museum who used to give tours of Lincoln Park, I wish this book had been published long ago.
