Rachel and Logan continue to share the narration as they try to salvage their city and their culture from the onslaught of warring parties and a beastly power with mythic attributes. In this episode, 19-year-old Logan, an unschooled but talented chemist and leader, and beautiful, sad Rachel confront political dangers within their small band of survivors as well as mortal danger from without. There are ready metaphors between Logan and Rachel’s world and the political shortcomings of our own, but Redwine has created such an engaging fantasy and well-developed foreground characters that readers can notice the similarities and revel in the rich world building at the same time. On top of these delights, the passion building between the two protagonists is palpable. New readers will want to finish Defiance first, but it won’t be long before they eagerly anticipate Deception’s future follow-up. Grades 8-10. --Francisca Goldsmith"}]}

Now, seeing the heart of that message poured into a full-length novel, I’m not just speechless, but amazed at the sacrifice our men and women in uniform—and their families—so willingly make to protect our freedom. Thanks, Mark, for reminding us all of the cost of liberty.”—Dave Ramsey, host of The Dave Ramsey Show, bestselling author ofThe Total Money Makeover“A compelling story of the love a mom, dad, and bride have for their soldier.Letters from Wargraphically reminds us of the price our soldiers and their families pay to protect our nation.

He closed out his set with ‘Letters from War’ accompanied by a very moving music video. I wept when I listened and watched the story unfold. What makes Mark special is that he is an advocate through song and story for the forgotten people of this world. He causes us to see our story in theirs, uniting through brokenness and hope.Letters from Waris a must read.”—Sandi Patty, Women of Faith speaker, most awarded female vocalist in Christian music history“As Americans we understand and admire the courage and strength of our military, but now Mark Schultz has taken us into the hearts of these freedom fighters.

Peter is \"a royal half-wit\" with all the physical (and intellectual) appeal of a halibut. Luckily, even before the wedding Sophia-Catherine-Marlene has already fallen in lust with the handsome, womanizing emissary Count Alexei, the first of many uniformed conquests. Melodrama doesn't come any more melo than this, and Dietrich doesn't really do much, except swivel those enormous searchlight eyes from one man to another, but this is one of her sexiest and most memorable roles. It culminates with her escaping from the Palace--and stealing the throne of Russia from the halibut (who by now is Peter III)--all dressed in Cossack uniform. The Empress, Peter's aunt, is played--somehow appropriately--with the accent and social grace of a New Jersey chambermaid. Great music, great lighting, and great camera work, all directed with an odd mixture of campy humor and glaring bombast by Josef von Sternberg.Scarlet Empresshas (to quote the titles) \"a supporting cast of 1,000 players\"; at least 950 of them look exactly like Rasputin.

Wood,Duke University“Historians of African Americans have known for a long time that they were brought to the Americas to labor, but until Frederick Knight’s comprehensive and fascinating account, that labor had never been fully examined. By looking at African labor and especially agricultural skills, Knight shows that a great deal of the work that African Americans did as slaves had its roots in African agricultural processes. Knight’s chapter on the production of indigo is particularly telling on this point, and shows that Africans’ skill was perhaps as important as their muscle in furthering the New World’s agricultural development. While others have explored elements of the role of Africans as skilled farmers before, Knight has brought all this and more together in a compelling and convincing re-evaluation of Africans and their descendants’ role in American life.”-John K. Thornton,author ofAfrica and Africans in the Formation of the Atlantic World, 1400-1680“Working the Diasporais a welcome contribution to the study of labor and culture under slavery. Spanning the colonial through the antebellum period, Knight argues that Africans brought much more than brute strength to their work in sugar, rice, tobacco and indigo fields. By carefully contextualizing his study of labor practices in the Americas in the African past, Knight offers a compelling argument for the crucial role of African knowledge in the building of staple crop agriculture in the Americas. In a study that is archivally deep and analytically rich, Knight significantly expands our understanding of the role of African expertise in the creation of the black Atlantic.”-Jennifer L.

Resembling the kaleidoscope quilt, this innovative approach allows the quilter to add a unique dimension to more traditional patchwork by adapting portions of the block to accommodate the geometry of elegant and colorful prints. By utilizing bold border prints and fabrics with strongly hued allover patterns, Beyer lets the pattern of each material dictate the boundaries of the pieced design. This beautifully presented book explains the method clearly, and the photos do justice to Beyer's exquisite sense of color and wonderful design abilities--her fabrics speak eloquently. The intricate appearance of the finished product belies the basic simplicity of the technique; somewhat more difficult may be the ability to look at fabrics in this new way to invent fresh design possibilities. But a general acquaintance with quilting and piecing techniques combined with the help of this terrific book should be enough to produce a truly dynamic quilt.--Amy Handy"}]}

When her husband drains their bank account and leaves her for a stripper, Lin retreats to her hometown of Mimosa Branch, Ga., to lick her wounds. Facing her conservative, gossipy Southern town as a newly divorced woman is no easy task, however, especially when her best friend lives miles away, her house has become a menagerie haunted by her Alzheimer's-stricken Uncle Bedford, and her boss at the drugstore is an uptight Northerner, Grant Owens, whom she finds disturbingly attractive. Determined to leave her meek hausfrau self behind and start taking charge of her life, she plots to seduce Grant and joins forces with an ex-con preacher with the proverbial heart of gold to oust the corrupt mayor from office. The story covers familiar territory, but Lin's efforts to make a home for herself in a now-unfamiliar town, to reconnect with her old friends and mend rifts with her family are well-observed and bittersweet. Snapshots of Southern living will charm the hardest-hearted Yankee; the purple bathtub full of pink begonias on Lin's mother's porch is irresistible. The inspirational tone becomes rather cloying as the happy-ever-after ending approaches, but strong characters and Smith's irrepressible wit anchor the fluff.Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}]}

Now even higher is the new voice of Joan Ball. Her splendor of rendering life in the spirit is unmatched. Open this book up anywhere, and it grabs you everywhere.” (Leonard Sweet; author of The Gospel According to Starbucks and more, professor of evangelism at Drew University and visiting distinguished professor at George Fox University, www.sermons)“If you didn't know better, you would mistakeFlirting with Faithfor a work of fiction. Even Joan Ball wouldn’t have believed the story—successful New York publicist gets blindsided by a supernatural smack down—had it not happened to her. But every part of Joan’s faith journey reeks of authenticity. And it’s not just the story ofFlirting with Faiththat will keep you turning the pages. Joan’s voice is one of the most original to come along in years. She’s bold and brash and filled with a kind of wide-eyed wonder that could only come from someone who has been “struck Christian.” (Stan Jantz, bestselling author of more than fifty books, including I’m Fine with God . . . It’s Christians I Can’t Stand and co-founder of ConversantLife.com)\"InFlirting with FaithJoan Ball reveals the scarred soul of an avowed atheist who found herself unexpectedly god-smacked. Fellow spiritual oddballs will delight in the discovery that while they may be unique they're not alone. Though Ball's story, they can find another broken believer who walked a crooked spiritual path that eventually wound its way to God.\" (Becky Garrison, religious satirist and author of Jesus Died for This?)“In a culture where far too many people are dismissive or completely indifferent when it comes to faith, it's refreshing to see it dealt with in such an honest and authentic fashion.Flirting with Faithis a roadmap on the often perilous and sometime exhilarating journey to discover eternity. Joan Ball reminds us that encountering real faith will change everything.” (Phil Cooke, filmmaker and author of Branding Faith and The Last TV Evangelist)“What Joan Ball gives us here is a conversion story that St. Paul himself could have written. Spiced with humor and told with all the natural story-telling skills of a true writer,Flirtingis, above all else, a dramatic, moving, and overwhelmingly credible confession of faith by one woman who never, ever meant to be converted. God apparently thought otherwise, and the resulting story will rejoice both your heart and your mind.” (Phyllis Tickle, Author of The Great Emergence)\"At once feisty and contemplative, Joan Ball'sFlirting with Faithmore than flirts: She dances with both faith and doubt, while being unflinchingly honest each step of the way. Her authentic wrestling will confound skeptics, challenge believers and comfort those who mourn.\" (Makoto Fujimura, artist, author of Refractions: a Journey of Art, Faith and Culture.)\"Flirting with Faithis so much more than a personal memoir. It's a vulnerable, spiritual journey. With each word, Joan Ball invites us to take a step into her heart where we see the beauty of transformation and the freedom of grace.\" (Anne Jackson, author of Mad Church Disease: Overcoming the Burnout Epidemic and Permission to Speak Freely)\"Storyteller Joan Ball has found a way into my mind, heart, and soul with the beautifully written tale of her accidental fall into the lap of faith. Joan’s story has escaped my lips to countless friends as easily as the catchiest pop hook. This story will remind you that you are ultimately not in control and when you finally accept that, the flirting with your faith will turn into a full blown romance.\" (Carlos Whittaker, Integrity Recording artist and blogger at RagamuffinSoul.com)"}]}

The progress recorded here is portrayed against a background of the players' struggles with strange foods, unfamiliar customs, a foreign culture, the language barrier, and the ever-present race issue in the United States. The author (history, California State Univ., Stanislaus) provides a political framework to the narrative?at times too much of one by typical baseball history standards.

Although some of what they said was true, the answers they gave were impersonal and lacking in intimacy, falling far short of the wisdom Job desperately needed. Job rejected their easy answers and longed instead for an answer straight from God.Written in American English, Eugene H. Peterson’s rendition of Job invites us to ask the difficult questions that arise when life seems to be spinning out of control. And with Job, we realize that simple solutions or complex formulas to the mysteries of life aren’t really what we need. What we really need is the relief and comfort that come from God himself, speaking to us out of the whirlwind."}]}

Agee (The Retired Kid) arranges this word game so that readers get a question and visual clues, then can identify the creature with a turn of the page. Following an image of a scaly brown critter on a nightstand (\"Who wakes Mr. Putney up in the morning?\"), Agee introduces the alarmadillo. When a red shellfish splashes Mr. Putney with green soup (\"What do you call Mr. Putney's messy lunch companion?\"), he presents the slobster. Even wordplay amateurs stand a chance of naming the title's quacking dog (a duckschund who barks--or is that buacks?--\"Quarf!\"). The visual contrast between the fussy-looking Mr. Putney and the various animal mutants is played up by the juxtaposition of the creatures' irreverent exclamations (\"Yo!\" shouts the alarmadillo) with Mr. Putney's dry delivery--\"Comfy?\" he asks the cramel that's shoved into his backpack.

Following Robert Ballard's discovery of the wreck in 1985 (see his Discovery of the Titanic, LJ 1/88), there have been numerous books retelling the epic story of the \"unsinkable ship\" on its maiden voyage with an insufficient number of lifeboats for passengers and crew. Quinn uses structural details gleaned from the accounts of Ballard and many survivors to reconstruct a vivid description of the final 20 minutes of the vessel's life. He has an excellent knowledge of the layout of the ship and has contributed several paintings showing the progress of the sinking. Of course, Quinn had to surmise various scenarios, including his dramatic descriptions of the rising water, the sounds of water flooding the various public rooms, and even which escape routes were likely taken by the third-class passengers.

FiberSMART is a soothing and nourishing blend of organic flax fiber, probiotics, herbs and amino acids and specially formulated for sensitive colons. FiberSMART contains a blend of organic flax fiber and guar gum, which together provide the balance of soluble to insoluble fiber that nature intended. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains provides an approximate ratio of 25-35% soluble fiber and 65-75% insoluble fiber. While both types of fiber are important in maintaining good health, the balance is equally important in promoting regularity. Too much soluble fiber can worsen a constipation or gas problem for some people.

Ex-CNN Pyongyang correspondent Chinoy details the rancorous infighting during which hardliners like John Bolton and Dick Cheney talked down State Department doves to impose an intransigent North Korea policy, replacing negotiations with Axis-of-Evil rhetoric and unilateral demands. Their approach backfired disastrously, he argues, as Pyongyang restarted and escalated its dormant nuclear initiative and finally tested an atom bomb while the U.S. fulminated helplessly—a needless outcome, he suggests, given the North Koreans' oft-expressed readiness to abandon their nuclear program in exchange for aid and normalized relations. Chinoy presents a lucid exposition of the issues along with a colorful account of diplomatic wrangling in which U.S. officials rivaled their North Korean counterparts in dogmatism and prickly sensitivity to niceties. (One joint statement was almost derailed when the Americans insisted on changing the phrase peaceful coexistence to exist peacefully together.) His is a fine, insightful diplomatic history of a dire confrontation—and a hard-hitting critique of the Bush administration's foreign policy.

Diane Maddex, who has written several books on Wright, has assembled a photographic collection of his living and dining rooms as well as playrooms, libraries, and a few public spaces, including Wisconsin's Johnson Wax building and the Guggenheim Museum in New York. Wright's signature style--a combination of arts and crafts and the \"prairie school\"--was achieved by designing human-scale spaces with beautifully crafted materials. Maddex includes the finest examples of this in the book. The rooms span Wright's entire career--from the Robie House in 1906 to the Guggenheim, which was completed in 1959 (after the architect's death)--and they demonstrate the evolution of his style. The photographs are sensational; they capture the light, scale, and color of each interior. Accompanying each photo is a brief description of the clients, their requirements, and what Wright created for them. This is a lovely book that serves as a beautiful historical record of one of the 20th century's greatest architects."}]}

He was drafted by the Brewers, but went from their training camp back to the farm system. He developed injuries that prevented him from pitching and practicing. Morris wouldn't let go of his dream of the major leagues, however. He married, had children, and held odd jobs and continued to work at his pitching while his wife supported him. Morris eventually grew tired of the routine, went to night school and became a high school teacher and later a coach. After his formerly abysmal baseball team won the district championship, his fellow coaches and students urged him to give his dream one last chance. More than a decade after his first tryout, Morris was offered a contract by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. This lively autobiography, written with Engel (coauthor of By George, George Foreman's autobiography), will entertain baseball fans and others who yearn to fulfill a childhood ambition. While the writing is polished, Morris's voice remains genuine. He is honest and likable, not least because he recognizes his family's sacrifices for him. While not essential reading for sports fans, this triumphant underdog story is an appealing contrast to those of the players with multimillion-dollar salaries. (Apr. 3) Forecast: With publication around the start of baseball season, an 11-city author tour and radio interviews, this book should get off to a fast start.Copyright 2001 Reed Business Information, Inc."}]}

Thought to have been popularized in Wales in the 17th century, flannel was an all-wool fabric made of woolen or worsted yarns, with a brushed surface and a soft napped finish obscuring its weave. Flannel may be plain woven or twill woven and, today, most flannel fabrics are made of cotton fibers or synthetic rayon fibers that are slightly napped on both sides to resemble the old woolen or worsted yarn weaves. A wide range of flannel weights and textures is available. The fabric weight and quality of the napping affect the warmth and softness of the fabric. Many people prefer flannel bedding during the cold, winter months, but some flannel weights are appropriate in breathability and comfort all year long."}]}

While proponents of the object paradigm often say identifying objects is a simple and intuitive process, experienced developers know that this is not always true. The solution is the CRC (Classes, Responsibilities, Collaboration) Card method, a proven technique for identifying classes and visualizing and testing different class-based models during the design phase.The CRC Card Bookcovers the CRC method from start to finish, illustrating its application in three different in-depth case studies which supply tips and pointers drawn from real world experience. The case studies are presented in the engaging style of a novella to demonstrate how personalities and organizational culture come into play when using the CRC technique. C++, Java, and Smalltalk experts provide implementation examples in each language.The CRC Card Bookdemonstrates how to:Discover classes through team brainstormingRefine project requirementsTest the conception of the system and evaluate potential paths of collaboration using role playManage an object-oriented projectImplement a CRC design in C++, Java, and Smalltalk; all source code is available via the World Wide Web.Includes language implementation examples from such noted experts as:Java:Cay Horstman, San Jose State UniversitySmalltalk:Larry Smith, IBM Corp.C++:Jeremy Raw, Interactive Software0201895358B04062001"}]}

As usual, Chivers has produced an excellent audio presentation of a literary masterpiece.

Each section opens with the question, \"What is a bike?,\" …a car? …a train? …a dump truck? and then provides the answer in an easy-to-read text. However, the vocabulary is not consistent. Words such as \"traction,\" \"tread,\" \"fertilizer,\" \"insecticide,\" and \"herbicide\" are omitted, but \"suspension\" and \"maneuverable\" are used. Most problematic is the section on \"Tractors and Farm Vehicles.\" The double-bladed plow that is shown is most likely of European origin and not usually seen in this country. The plowed ground is on the wrong side of the tractor and a plow does not make furrows or \"chop up the dirt.\" Wheat is not \"collected,\" it is harvested. The reel, the part that spins on the front of the combine, does not cut the grain stalk. The cut stalks are not sucked into the combine, but are augered to the center of the header and into the combine. In most cases, wheat straw is not baled. If it is baled, it is not used as fodder as it has very little food value. It most definitely is not cut by the baler. Oversimplified vocabulary and inaccuracies keep this book from being even a marginal purchase.—Eldon Younce, formerly at Harper Elementary School, KSCopyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As a practicing veterinarian in the 1960's Dr Ted Lafeber Sr. was treating pet birds and soon realized that most pet birds were suffering from malnutrition. Birds can not survive on millet, canary seed and sunflower seeds alone. In 1975, he created the very first pet bird pellet recipe. Initially, many people thought he was crazy, birds eat seeds, not pellets, but then they saw the results the birds eating pellets were healthier, happier and living longer. Nutritionally Balanced Good health and a long life begin with proper nutrition and Lafeber' s Premium Daily Diet is formulated to provide exactly that. Lafeber' s Premium Daily Diet is a high quality blend of natural ingredients like ground non-GMO corn and soybean meal. Both grains are literally grown outside Lafeber Company's front door. We also add whole egg, the world's most digestive form of protein. The different grains are mixed and essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids are added which are necessary for strong bones and brilliant feathers. Watch your feathered friend shine with the excellent nutrition found in Lafeber' s pelleted bird food. Balancing the Omega Fatty Acids increases immune function. Generally, increased immune function helps the body's ability to fight disease. Balanced Omega 3 & 6's also improves the quality of the skin. More than ever, each pelleted recipe provides excellent nutrition for your loved feathered companion. Creating the first Omega 3 & 6 balanced pet bird pellet is just one of the reasons Lafeber Company is considered the leader in avian nutrition. Our veterinarians and nutritionist determined the best combination of natural preservatives, specifically mixed tocopherols and citric acid, to protect the nutrients of Lafeber' s Premium Daily Diet pellets. Our pellets are naturally flavored with the great taste of molasses. Molasses provides the energy birds need and a taste birds enjoy."}]}

However, although a father of the creative writing program, he composed few pages on fiction as received art and teachable craft. This slim volume brings them together, essays and interviews, published and unpublished, to provide invaluable guidance for writers of all levels. Though there is practical advice here, these pieces don't provide blueprints for building a work of fiction but rather a shopping list of the tools a good writer needs in her toolbox: patience, humility, and character. It's all stated so epigrammatically that readers who underline are advised to start with a fresh pen. What lingers is a refreshingly classic (to call it old-fashioned would imply we don't need it) sense of the writer as a well-rounded individual. As daughter-in-law Lynn Stegner writes in the foreword, Wallace Stegner might have said, \"A writer must aim to be the sort of man from whom a masterpiece is possible.\"Keir GraffCopyright © American Library Association.

The authors, professors of management at Hitosubashi University, contend that Japanese firms are successful because they are innovative, that is, because they create new knowledge and use it to produce successful products and technologies. They identify two types of organizational knowledge: explicit knowledge, contained in procedures and manuals, and tacit knowledge, learned only by experience. U.S. managers tend to focus on explicit knowledge and stress approaches such as benchmarking, while the Japanese focus on tacit knowledge. Using corporate examples such as Honda, NEC, Nissan, 3M, and GE, the authors provide insights that reveal how to blend the best of both worlds. This scholarly volume is highly recommended not only for academics (especially in organizational theory) but also for readers doing business in and with Japan.?Joseph W.

But many other Christians say feelings are altogether unreliable and unimportant. The way we feel doesn't matter; what really matters is how we think. The truth is, God wants us to avoid both extremes. God wants his people to experience their relationship to him in the way they think and feel. When you think rightly about God, it helps you feel rightly for God. But the reverse is also true: when you feel rightly for God, it also helps you to think rightly about God. True feelings inform true thoughts just as true thoughts inform true feelings. In this excellent book Brian Borgman shows that love for God is more than feelings, but never less. Furthermore, he shows that there is a huge difference between emotionalism and God-centered emotion. If you have been looking for a clear, practical, and balanced book on the appropriate role of feelings in the Christian life, look no further.\"—Tullian Tchividjian,Pastor, Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church, Fort Lauderdale, Florida; author,One Way Love: Inexhaustible Grace for an Exhausted World\"Brian Borgman has written a wonderfully Christ-centered and God-glorifying book about how, by God's grace, to restore your emotions to God's image. Feelings and Faith paints a biblically accurate picture of, as the Puritan pastors expressed it, 'holy emotions.' It does not dismiss emotions as some do nor does it worship emotions as some do. This is an important book and I highly recommend it.\"—Martha Peace,Biblical Counselor; Author,The Excellent Wife\"Here is a readable but comprehensive study that unites in biblical friendship the Christian's theology and experience. With the heart of a pastor, Brain Borgman offers an emotional life line that will stabilize your heart and support your faith. Faith and Feelings needs to be in your personal library. I will return to it time and again-so will you!\"—Jani Ortlund,Executive Vice President, Renewal Ministries; author,Fearlessly Feminine and His Loving Law, Our Lasting Legacy\"As Christians, who hasn't been confused about the relationship between our faith and our feelings? Are feelings an incredibly important part of your faith, giving you heart-felt ways to express love to God and others, or are they actually to be jettisoned from your faith, being perceived as something dangerous in your relationship to Christ? In this immensely profitable book, Brian Borgman, a very sure-footed guide to this topic, biblically and precisely explains the concept of emotion and how it is to be integrated into one's walk with the Lord. I know of no other book quite like it. All at once, it is Scriptural, wise, clear, pastoral, transparent, and compelling. This is a great resource for instance, for a pastor who desires help in skillfully shepherding his sheep. It is also a wonderful help for a discipler and/or counselor who wants to instruct his disciples and counselees with their fears, worries, and anxieties. Even further, the principles in this work should prove to be of real, lasting value to any believer in Jesus who earnestly yearns to first grasp and then harness his or her own emotions within the context of a sensate culture that is quickly careening out of emotional control. For all who read this book, we should genuinely applaud Pastor Borgman's diligent efforts in now bringing us the most helpful volume available on the subject of Faith and Feelings.\"—Lance Quinn,Pastor-Teacher, The Bible Church of Little Rock, Little Rock, Arkansas\"Brian Borgman has done a lot of work on this crucial topic and it really shows. Emotion is one of the least understood topics in our Bible studies and churches and this is a strong contribution to the discussion. I am thankful to have read Feelings and Faith and know others will also benefit from it. It has been a privilege to get to know Brian and his pastor's heart for God's people, which shines through clearly on these pages.\"—Matthew Elliott,Author,Feel: The Power of Listening to Your Heart;Faithful Feelings: Rethinking Emotion in the New Testament\"Martyn Lloyd-Jones taught us that if we see truth clearly, we must feel it. Authentic faith in the supreme, indomitable goodness of God in sending Jesus Christ as our substitute and redeemer necessarily transforms our feelings. The Holy Spirit awakens earnest love for others from a pure heart (I Peter 1:22), joyful acceptance of loss (Heb. 10:34), and cheerful generosity (II Cor. 9:7). Pastor Brian Borgman's Feelings and Faith stands in the great tradition of Desiring God by John Piper and Spiritual Depression by Martyn Lloyd-Jones. Borgman clearly sets forth the foundational role of truth, unpacks a robust theology of Christian experience, and provides examples of how to mortify sinful emotions and cultivate godly ones. I highly recommend this book.\"—Alex Chediak,Associate Professor of Engineering and Physics, California Baptist University; Author,With One Voice"}]}

He's determined to join theShinsengumi, a group of ronin (masterless samurai) the Shogun organized to protect the capitol.

A respectable establishment frequented by any number of questionable characters such as buccaneers, sailors and others who desired a taste of some of the famous fare the Tavern was known for. Named after Wicked Jack Scarborough, a mysterious gent and original proprietor who founded the tavern and disappeared suddenly without a trace weeks after opening. Taking over the helm was a robust old widow, known to locals, as “Ol Gran” believed to be a cousin of Jack Scarborough. Who, despite her kindly demeanor drew a hard line with her clientele. Even the harshest patrons considered cleaning up their act a small cost to pay for the opportunity to indulge in some of Ol Gran’s specialties. Her most popular concoction was the tavern’s own rum cake. The legend of Wicked Jack’s Tavern lives. We believe delicious recipes made with the worlds best rum and combined with the finest ingredients is how Ol Gran built Wicked Jack’s reputation.

Lack of justice in the private sphere of gender-structured marriage leads to a lack of justice in the public sphere of the work place, the professions, and politics. Marriage makes women vulnerable due to the devaluation of human reproductive work and the persistence of a traditional division of labor within marriage. Divorce compounds the problem since it results in poverty for many women. This is a strong study of the contradictions in a democratic form of government, but Okin's recommendations lack analysis and are not fully linked to the political and economic arena.

Its chemical structure is similar to that of galactomannan (from guar gum) and comprises a polysaccharide chain of glucose and mannose. Glucomannan can absorb up to 200 times its weight in water and forms a thick, gel-like mass that has been shown to be approximately five times greater than that of guar gum. How does glucomannan support health?As a water-soluble fiber, glucomannan is appropriate for the relief of occasional constipation.* The unique, bulk-forming property of glucomannan makes it a top-performing fiber specifically suited for providing a feeling of satiety (fullness) and promoting healthy weight loss.*Glucomannan may be used as part of your diet to help maintain a healthy blood sugar level.*Promotes healthy blood lipid metabolism and helps maintain cholesterol levels that are already within the normal range.*Why choose Vitacost Glucomannan?Has no unpleasant smell or taste.Has high absorption properties, meaning it can be taken in much smaller quantities than other fibers like pectin or guar gum.About VitacostVitacost nutritional products are manufactured to high standards of quality, efficacy and safety.
