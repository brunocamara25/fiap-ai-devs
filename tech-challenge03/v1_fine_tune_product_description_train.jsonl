Glory Boughton, now 38 and lovelorn, has returned toGileadto care for her dying father. Her wayward brother Jack also finds his way back, though his is an uneasy homecoming, reverberating with the scandal that drove him away twenty years earlier. Glory and Jack unravel their stories slowly, speaking to each other more in movements than in words--a careful glance here, a chair pulled out from the table there--against a domestic backdrop so richly imagined you may be fooled into believing their house is your own. Meanwhile, their father, whose ebullient love for his children is a welcome counterpoint to Glory and Jack's conflicted emotions, experiences his own kind of reckoning as he yearns to understand his troubled son. There is a simplicity to this story that belies the complexity of its characters--they are bound together by a profound capacity for love and by an equally powerful sense of private conviction that tries the ties that bind, but never breaks them. It's a delicate sort of tension that you think would resist exposition--and in fact these characters seem to want nothing more than, as Glory says, to treat \"one another's deceptions like truth\"--but Marilynne Robinson's fine, tender prose imbues this family's secrets with an overwhelming grace. --Anne Bartholomew--This text refers to theHardcoveredition."}]}

Most everyone knows that Ultra Wire is the essential material needed for tying John Barr's famous Copper John nymph, but it can also be used several different ways:The original use for Ultra Wire is as a rib on a nymph. Gold Ultra Wire is ideal for Hares Ear nymphs or similar patterns. Black and Brown Ultra Wire are often chosen as a rib on stonefly nymphs. Ultra Wire is also great in the smaller sizes for tying even the smallest midges. Need to tie a size 28 Zebra Midge? Then look to the XS size which is ideal for ribbing size 22 or smaller flies.Flies can be tied completely out of Ultra Wire if you desire. Karl Schmuecker's Iron Midge is simply an all wire version of the famous Brassie. It istiedwith nothing more than Ultra Wire wrapped on the hook then coated with epoxy. If you want to \"get fancy\", you can wrap a nice head of thread in front of the wire. The Iron Midge works in the same situations in which a San Juan worm is most effective. Because the fly is nothing more than Ultra Wire and epoxy, it sinks like a rock and is an awesome pattern for deep, fast water.For a unique look, try wrapping two different colors of Ultra Wire together making a banded, segmented body. Another neat trick is to insert a piece of Ultra Wire into clear or colored stretch tubing. When wrapped, this makes a wild looking segmented body.No matter what type of fly you are tying there is a size or color of Ultra Wire that is ideal. Since Ultra Wire is a non-tarnishing wire, the colors will remain rich, vibrant, and bold long after your flies have been tied. You can expect their color to remain true for their entire life in your fly box."}]}

Fortey maintains the reader's interest throughout by his use of lyrical, commonly humorous language and excellent black-and-white drawings and color photographs . . . This book offers an excellent introduction to paleontology, pulling together in a concise manner the multiple facets that make contemporary paleontology a dynamic and exciting field of study.”—Samantha A.

It is not a picture book, yet it provides many good pictures of fossils. It is not a textbook, yet it provides excellent text on fossils. So, what is it? Answer: It is a rarity among its flashier rivals in the publishing trade.Fossilsis a clearly written, straightforward book . . . This is an excellent and intelligent book.”—William C. Philips,The Science Teacher“[This book] is written in a clear and engaging style, technical terms are minimized but well defined, and complex concepts are simplified yet accurately presented such that both novice and professional will profit from this work . . . Fortey's many years of service as a paleontologist with the British Museum of Natural History prepared him well for the technical material presented, but his superb writing ability will account for much of the probable success of this book. It should appeal . . . to anyone interested in a very readable account of the history of life on our planet.”—Choice"}]}

Readers are reintroduced to the four characters who made the other series so popular: Sandry, who has worked at her uncle's these past two years; Tris, who has developed a new power that she is afraid to share; Daja, who immediately renews her link with Sandry; and Briar, who is afraid to open up because of his memories of the war. Sandry still holds the circle that binds these four individuals together, creating a strong whole out of four very diverse parts. When the book opens, they refuse to reopen the link that has made them stronger due to changes in their lives. Sandry discovers that the lands she holds for the Empress will be given away unless she returns home. Her uncle talks her friends into accompanying her. She hopes to visit her lands and leave by fall, but the Empress has other plans for her, including marriage. After the Empress meets her friends, she devises plans to keep them all. Readers will enjoy being reacquainted with these older but still very well-developed characters.

It's fast, furious, relentless--and we're all in the midst of it. Indeed, it's the topic of choice for most business books on the market today. The problem, however, is that so many of these books merely warn managers how to plan for and anticipate change, rather than giving useful guidance on how to react to it successfully.That's where the authors ofThe Minding Organizationhave made a difference. Rubinstein and Firstenberg believe that the real issue for businesses dealing with change lies in developing a truly adaptable organization. Being able to adapt, they argue, is the key not only to coping with a continuously changing environment but to addressing the problems that arise within that environment with innovative, successful solutions. An adaptable organization is a living, breathing organism, a \"minding organization\" that coordinates its goals and efforts as a single being. Each part of the organization knows what the other parts are doing, and is committed to creating a cohesive unit that maintains a unified focus for the future, shares information, articulates and learns from the individual errors of its members, continually seeks to strengthen its powers of perception, and is able to express itself creatively in a variety of ways. By developing this unity, an organization can bring the future closer to the present; it will be able to respond to events in real time, thereby transforming change from a threat to continued existence to a catalyst for improved performance. This type of organization won't shy away from the chaos of change but will embrace its opportunities, ready and well equipped to respond quickly and effectively.The Minding Organizationis a meaty book, packed with inspiring examples, solid analyses, and practical suggestions. Rubinstein, a professor at the UCLA School of Engineering and Applied Science, and Firstenberg, an adjunct professor in UCLA's Psychology Department, make a good team (they also wrotePatterns of Problem Solving). They apply theoretical knowledge and practical experience to the realities of the business world in a timely and useful manner. Forget being the CEO; this book will teach you how to be an OEC, an operator on the edge of chaos, capable of inspiring and leading a flexible, evolving, and thriving organization.--S. Ketchum"}]}

Six-month-old Justin Wallace and his teenage baby-sitter are abducted from a small-town park; the police find the baby-sitter's body in the woods, but baby Justin's fate is unclear. Meanwhile, high-school teacher Doug Blake has just been exonerated of sexually harassing the daughter of the local police chief, but his compulsive attraction to his teenage charges threatens the happiness of his wife, Maddy, and their small daughter. Soon witnesses place Doug at the scene of the abduction. Is the police chief simply carrying out a vendetta against Doug? Or does Doug know more than he admits? Maddy battles a dangerous attraction to her charismatic priest, Father Nick, as she tries to hold her world together. Other suspects include a childless, middle-aged woman obsessed with the death of her son and a sinister born-again couple who move into the Blakes' house after a minor car accident and arouse Maddy's suspicions: Could their beautiful child be Justin Wallace? Maddy's knowledge puts her into a perilous situation from which only Father Nick can save her. Despite this competent sequence of events, the novel suffers from MacDonald's superficial insight into characters, and the happy ending to Maddy's tribulations is all-too predictable.Copyright 1998 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}]}

It did not go well: the men began arguing, and eventually, Wittgenstein began waving a fire poker toward Popper. It lasted scarcely 10 minutes, yet the debate has turned into perhaps modern philosophy's most contentious encounter, largely because none of the eyewitnesses could agree on what happened. Did Wittgenstein physically threaten Popper with the poker? Did Popper lie about it afterward? BBC journalists Edmonds and Eidinow use the controversy as a springboard to probe the whys and whats of these two great thinkers, weaving biography, journalism and philosophy to produce one of the year's most entertaining and intellectually rich books. The authors show that the debate was a clash at several levels. First, of personalities: each was \"bullying, aggressive, intolerant and self-absorbed\"; in other words, accustomed to winning and unlikely to back down. Second, of class: Wittgenstein was an Austrian aristocrat, Popper was bourgeoisie (each fled Vienna to escape Hitler). And third, of ideas: Wittgenstein believed that philosophy boiled down to nothing more than a series of linguistic puzzles, while Popper thought philosophy involved real problems that immediately affected the world at large. Clearly, the stakes were high for both men in that lecture hall especially because their common mentor, the aging icon Bertrand Russell, was also in attendance. The debate thus took on the character of a succession for the throne. Tightly constructed and extraordinarily well written, this is a marvelous blend of lay and academic scholarship. It has every chance of becoming a classic of its kind. (Nov.)Forecast: Smart, general readers will gobble up this latest addition to narrative nonfiction. It will surely find a place for itself among The Professor and the Madman and An Eternal Golden Braid.Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}]}

This book is part of the new Art handbooks series looking at different painting media. I like this artist's finished work especially 'Waiting For The Tide'. He'll show you how to create atmosphere, water and more with this excellent introduction to pastels. This book was previously published in 1999.-Yarnsandfabrics.co.uk/crafts This is a \"new\" series from Search Press that raids their extensive and, let's be honest, excellent backlist. Once upon a time, my children, these books were part of the Leisure Arts series, something which itself went through more than one incarnation. These are the first two titles in what could be an extensive re-publishing programme. They're simple beginners' guides (\"simple\" applies to the books, not the beginners, for the avoidance of confusion). What you get is a basic introduction to materials and equipment, some general notes on techniques and then some very short demonstrations that flex your muscles gently without any danger of over-exertion, all in 48 pages. I don't think anyone could learn to paint from just these books, but that's not what they were intended for. As a general introduction for someone putting a toe in the water - either as a complete novice or as a newcomer to the medium, they're a good way of easing yourself in. More perhaps than any other series, they absolutely stand or fall on how well the authors have understood the basic brief and, as Search Press usually contrive, they do it well. These were only ever intended to be pocket guides and, although the previous release was about A4 size, these new ones are only about half that. Normally, I don't like small-format books and I invariably fail to see the point of a book you can carry about with you. Give me illustrations I can see without my super-strength glasses, for goodness sake! However, I've been seduced by the way these sit in the hand. They're slightly larger than the Top Tips series and I've never complained about the size of the illustrations in those. It's also worth remarking that these books are a vindication of this site's policy of only reviewing from finished copies, rather than advance proofs. By getting the feel of the books in my hand, I've discovered that what I originally thought was an incredibly bad idea actually works well. All-in-all, a good job has been done here. The material has been brought subtly up to date and some perfectly good books whose only crime is to be middle-aged have been brought back to life. At GBP4.99, they compare well with the old pricing, too.-Artbookreview.net This petite guide focuses upon the basics for those new to this medium. It covers materials, mark making, color blending, composition, and perspective. It offers a selection of step-by-step painting exercises and covers a range of subjects including landscapes and water, discusses techniques such as use of a limited palette, and offers suggestions for creating atmosphere within a picture. VERDICT: Those who wish to cut to the chase can use this minimalist guide to learn pastels quickly.-Library Journal USA--This text refers to an alternatePaperbackedition."}]}

For readers who enjoy big galloping yarns set in distant lands, and don't mind having their hands held by the author every step of the way, the first volume of his new Christian trilogy should hit the spot.The framing device begins at the end of the nineteenth century, in Edinburgh, where Gordon Murray is about to be inducted into an ancient brotherhood whose secret rites involve a sacred relic: the iron lance of the title. The main narrative is set in eleventh century Orkney. When Pope Urban II calls for the retaking of Jerusalem from the infidel, the local lord, Ranulf, joins the Crusade with his elder sons, leaving behind young Murdo to oversee the family holdings. When the Church, through a nefarious scheme, confiscates the house and holdings, Murdo has no choice but to follow the Crusaders to the Holy Land and bring his father home to fix the whole mess.Lawhead paints a vast and exotic canvas of medieval world politics, then peoples it with colorful characters--cunning Byzantine rulers, bluff Norman knights, gap-toothed, shaggy-brained Saxon peasants--who encounter visions and miracles, brutality and ambition, love and justice. At the end of the main narrative, Murdo gets what he wants but not in the ways expected. The framing narrative ends with hints that, as the world lurches towards a new millennium, Gordon Murray's Christian secret society is the world's only hope for survival, and the time nears for the brotherhood to reveal itself.--Luc Duplessis--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}]}

The formerAuroracabin boy, now a student at the prestigious Paris Airship Academy, is on a two-week training tour with a run-down cargo airship when his captain sights a legendary ghost ship. Matt recklessly heads skyward in pursuit--only to risk sacrificing his entire crew to altitude sickness. TheHyperion, lost in a storm in the dawn of the aviation age and buoyed high above the clouds for 40 years, is rumoured to hold great wealth, and Matt is suddenly the only person on earth who knows her coordinates.Soon, he and his upper-class sweetheart, Kate de Vries, are embarked on a dangerous aerial treasure hunt, along with Hal, the conceited pilot of a sleek, new altitude-friendly airship, and a mysterious gypsy girl named Nadira, who claims to have the key to theHyperion's booby-trapped treasure troves. Drawing on the myths of Icarus and Prometheus, as well as classic sea adventures like20,000 Leagues Under the SeaandThe Poseidon Adventure,Skybreakercombines an action-packed thriller with a sensitive exploration of the limits of human ambition. Matt's jealousy of the self-made Hal (who he suspects has designs on Kate) and his own furtive attraction to Nadira heighten the emotional tension and raw suspense of the visceral scenes aboard theHyperion, an ice-entombed version of theTitanic. With pirates, sky monsters, and disturbed spirits, not to mention enough bizarre flying machines to fill an aviation museum (even a bat-copter forSilverwingfans),Skybreakerconfirms Kenneth Oppel's reputation as Canada's leading fantasy author for children and young adults.--Lisa Alward--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."}]}

After three volumes of hilarious slacking—a jobless trek of playing in a band, wobbling between romantic entanglements and battling the seven evil ex-boyfriends of his current girlfriend, Ramona Flowers—Scott Pilgrim must finally make choices. Does he truly love mysterious messenger Ramona? Will his band SexBobOmb play out? Can he pay the rent? Can he keep a job? And why is be being followed by two ninjas? O'Malley's manga-tinged youth comedy has gotten more confident as the series has become a veritable institution, with an eight-page color section to open this volume, but the story, too, reveals new layers of character. This time out the main complication in Scott's life is Julie, a high school might-have-been-girlfriend. Cute Julie keeps showering him with attention, forcing him to deal with his feelings for Ramona, who also has a visitor from her past. The references from indie band lore, video games and manga keep the story sharp, while the occasional fight scenes—Scott must face two opponents at once!—are perfect metaphors for the uncertainty and excitement of being an early 20-something. O'Malley's sparkling dialogue captures the bravado, insensitivity and engaging cluelessness of a generation for whom a dishwashing job constitutes getting it together big time.(Nov.)Copyright © Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Every iPhone sold serves as counter-evidence. So does every text message sent, every corporate merger finalized, every aluminum can recycled. And we haven’t even mentioned the biggest changes: Getting married. Having kids. (If people hate change, then having a kid is an awfully dumb decision.)It puzzled us--why do some huge changes, like marriage, come joyously, while some trivial changes, like submitting an expense report on time, meet fierce resistance?We found the answer in the research of some brilliant psychologists who’d discovered that people have two separate “systems” in their brains—a rational system and an emotional system. The rational system is a thoughtful, logical planner. The emotional system is, well, emotional—and impulsive and instinctual.When these two systems are in alignment, change can come quickly and easily (as when a dreamy-eyed couple gets married). When they’re not, change can be grueling (as anyone who has struggled with a diet can attest).In those situations where change is hard, is it possible to align the two systems? Is it possible to overcome our internal \"schizophrenia\" about change? We believe it is.In our research, we studied people trying to make difficult changes: People fighting to lose weight and keep it off. Managers trying to overhaul an entrenched bureaucracy. Activists combatting seemingly intractable problems such as child malnutrition. They succeeded--and, to our surprise, we found striking similarities in the strategies they used. They seemed to share a similar game plan. We wanted, inSwitch, to make that game plan available to everyone, in hopes that we could show people how to make the hard changes in life a little bit easier.--Chip and Dan Heath(Photo © Amy Surdacki)"}]}

But since Casey's father and grandfather run the third best umpire school in the country, Casey's passion is understandable. He also wants to become a sports journalist. When one of his father's students is revealed as a former major league baseball player who disappeared after a steroid scandal, Casey thinks he has stumbled onto the scoop of the year. But after learning about journalistic objectivity, dealing with his parent's divorce, and helping keep his wacky best friend out of trouble, nothing is going Casey's way. Vernick has written a truly realistic 12-year-old boy in Casey. He is all kid; smart but impetuous, with a good heart. His yearning to be a reporter and get published without doing much work rings true, as does his eventual realization that big dreams do not happen without effort. The umpire school is an intriguing angle to use as a hook to the story. There is enough baseball to keep fans interested, and yet not so much that it might turn off non-sports lovers. The book includes discussions of major league drug use, the aftereffects of divorce, and a bit of parental neglect, but everything is balanced; it all feeds the story, nothing seems thrown in for sensationalism. A solid choice for middle-grade readers.—Geri Diorio, Ridgefield Library, CT"}]}

DeVita then blends them together with pure Tomato Lycopene Complex (TLC!), a great source of anti-oxidant rich Lycopene, to formulate the ultimate in facial detoxification. We guarantee this masque will be unlike any you've tried in the past - the results are dramatic! Our skin care doesn't just sit around looking pretty. Our products work hard to help boost microcirculation and nourish your skin. Note: This is an active mask. Impurities are drawn to the surface and circulation is increased which may cause your skin to look a little red after mask is rinsed off - this is completely natural and only means the mask is working! May also cause temporary tingling, blushing, and warmth. Typically these sensations last 20 minutes or less (your experience may vary). As your skin adjusts, sensations will diminish while you continue enjoying all the benefits of enhanced facial circulation. You can feel it working...and that's a good thing. If skin continues to show signs of irritation and rash, reduce use. Never use more than once per day. Should signs persist, discontinue usage."}]}

The startling thing about this early venture into Monk's music, the first album by other musicians devoted to Monk, is that Lacy was already foregoing the better known tunes, concentrating on Monk repertoire that was seldom played outside the pianist's own groups.

I believe Captain Korolev has much more to say, and I look forward to his next outing.--BookreporterReaders will want to see more of Korolev, a weary but determined cop who puts justice ahead of Stalinist politics--at his peril.--Publishers WeeklyRyan's follow-up does not disappoint. His hero, Captain Alexei Korolev ... dissatisfied and morose, manages to cling to his job and his life while all around him are losing theirs.Ryan has obviously done much research into that sinister period of Russian history and manages to convey its claustrophobic atmosphere brilliantly.--The London TimesPraise forThe Darkening Field“Booklistlauded Ryan’s first Korolev novel,The Holy Thief, and this successor fully delivers on the promise of that judgment. Korolev is a wonderful character, a spiritual ancestor of Martin Cruz Smith’s Arkady Renko, persevering amid the murderous paranoia of Stalin’s Russia. The plot is intricate, the action satisfying, and Ryan’s use of period detail, including the brutal “collectivization“ of the Ukraine and that region’s nationalist and anarchist movements, makes for exhilarating reading.\"--Booklist(starred review)Praise forThe Holy Thief\"One of the year's most exciting [debuts]... While the search for Russian icons will bring to mind Martin Cruz Smith's brilliant Gorky Park, Ryan puts a fresh, original spin on the briskly pacedThe Holy Thiefdelving into Soviet politics, culture and corruption.\"--Oline H. Cogdill,Florida Sun-Sentinel“Korolev also is a moral, compassionate man who becomes increasingly horrified by Soviet society... This is British writer William Ryan's first historical mystery... One hopes there is more of Korolev to come.”--Minneapolis Star Tribune\"Impressive... Ryan, who merits comparison to Tom Rob Smith, makes palpable the perpetual state of fear of being reported as disloyal, besides dramatizing the difficulty of being an honest cop in a repressive police state. Readers will hope Korolev has a long career ahead of him.\"--Publishers Weekly(starred)\"Remarkable thriller... In his solitude and resolve, Ryan's Korolev evokes Martin Cruz Smith's fierce Arkady Renko, while the period detail and gore call to mind Tom Rob Smith.\"--Library Journal“William Ryan brilliantly captures the eerie paranoia of Stalinist Moscow, which serves as an endlessly fascinating background for his compelling tale. This is a non-stop page-turner and a remarkable debut.\"--David Liss, author ofThe Devil’s Company"}]}

It was founded in 1972, the company derives its name from an entertaining aspect of tea folklore. In earlier centuries, tea was a valuable commodity traditionally transported by clipper ship. The ship's captain often was presented with some of the finest teas for his personal use. This supply was his stash, stowed carefully as his private reserve. Today, the term still is used to denote anything put away carefully because of its preciousness. Stash premium double bergamot earl grey black tea has twice as much bergamot oil as the earl grey tea. The black tea base still serves as a solid foundation for this blend, but the bergamot oil takes wing and soars to new unprecedented heights. The flavor is quite pronounced but not at all soapy or bitter which would happen with low grade oils. Is the flavor too strong? For a conservative drinker, maybe yes, but more adventurous types really seem to like it. This is a great late afternoon or early evening tea. It goes very well with shortbread and cream scones. Bergamot, an extract from the fruit of the small Citric bergamia tree is grown in the southern part of Calabria, Italy. Many other Earl Grey teas use a mix of bergamot and other citrus oils, but Stash insist on 100 percent pure bergamot even though it's more expensive, and for a uniquely appealing cold beverage try Double Bergamot earl grey tea on ice. Stash tea has been committed to providing premium quality teas and an unsurpassed tea drinking experience. Stash begins with simply excellent tea leaves from the world's premier tea gardens and all natural botanical ingredients gathered from around the world. Meticulous blending and tasting of every tea ensures you will enjoy full flavor in every cup."}]}

There's big biotech money involved, enough to keep the so-called Vaughn Street Glee Club intent on making sure anyone who knows about their plans is silenced. Permanently, if necessary. It's up to Amanda to unmask the reason why the Glee Club is so anxious for her client Jon Dupre, the accused killer of a U.S. senator, to go down for murder. And what she learns about the lengths to which they'll go to keep their secrets, including killing members of their own family, threatens her life as well. Margolin strings a clumsy plot on a weak thread--why three affluent college boys become killers is never adequately explained--and the heroine, whose dogged perseverance is admirable, is otherwise too boring to capture the reader's interest.--Jane Adams"}]}
